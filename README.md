# React Native App for a differential mobile robot
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
## 1. Prerequisites

<p align="justify">
Have installed on your computer, ROS Melodic, ROS Melodic packages: gazebo ros plugin, gazebo ros, react-native.
</p>

Having created a catkin workspace.

## 2. Packages

<p align="justify">
The ReactNativeControl folder has the control of robot and the interaction with the reat-native app. If you want to use the same robot, I invite you a my other porject a clone the repository:
</p>

<https://github.com/Juanesb230/PYQT-RVIZ>

<p align="justify">
The react-native app is into NativePrueba folder online clone the repository, go to the NativePrueba folder and puth the followings command:
</p>

npm option:

    npm install

or yarn option:

    yarn install

runs the aplication with an emulator of your phone:

    react-native run-android

<p align="justify">
For the master, you have to init the rosbridge server with this command:
</p>

    roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch

<p align="justify">
If you want to use the robot designed, you have to install the package of the previous link in your catkin workspace, and put the following command in other terminal:
</p>

    roslaunch diferencial 01-diferencial.launch

<p align="justify">
Finally, have to run the control node, for that you have to install as package the ReactNativeControl folder in your catkin workspace and put the next line:
</p>

    rosrun ReactNativeControl ControlReactNative.py

## 3. Description

<p align="justify">
The App is a ROS node that can communicate with the master with rosbridge. For the frond-end I use native-base and for the ROS interaction I use roslibjs. This app use Redux and Redux-persist for managing the states of the app, as you can see in the animation:

And the next animation shows the communication of the App with the master node with rosbridge.

## 4. Results

<p align="justify">
In this demostration I use my Android cellphone and ApowerMirror for shows the screen of phone. If you want to use ApowerMirror you can donwload in the next link:

<p align="justify">
This app publish a topic named "/mode" for the controller know if the app user is in teleoperation, posture or trajectory control mode. The next Table shows the messages sends to the topic "/mode" depending the app mode operation that the ControlReactNative node is suscribed:
</p>

| Mode | Message (stds_msgs:string) |
| --- | --- |
| Teleoperation | 'Teleoperation' |
| Posture Control | 'Posture Control' |
| Trajectory Control | 'Tray Control' |

<p align="justify">
For teleoperation mode, you can chose the name topic  to publihs velocities of robot. For my robot, the name topic is "/mobile_base_controller/cmd_vel", this animation shows the teleoperation mode.
</p>

</p>

<p align="justify">
In the settings button, you can set the velocities of robot.

In the posture control mode, the user can set the X, Y position and the robot is going to that point. The x and y references is sending as  ROSÂ´parameters. The next animation shows the posture control mode of the robot.
</p>

</p>

<p align="justify">
Finally the trajectory mode, this mode the user can chose the trajectory of the robot. When you chose a different trajectory the app sends a ROS' parameter named TrayMode. The following animation shows this mode.
